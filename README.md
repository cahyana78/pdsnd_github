### Project Title
Explore US Bikeshare Data

### Description
In this project, the student (which is me) is required to to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States; Chicago, New York City, and Washington. This project will make use of Python, and the written code is utilised to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. There is also a script code that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

### Files used
There are four files required in this project:
* bikeshare.py, a python file where all codes were written
* chicago.csv, data set for bike share system in Chicago
* new_york_city.csv, data set for bike share system in New York City
* washington.csv, data set for bike share system in Washington

### Software Requirement
If we want to complete this project in our local machine (not in Udacity workspace), software needed to accomplish it are:
* Python 3, NumPy, and pandas installed using Anaconda
* A text editor, like Sublime or Atom (I recommend VS Code)
* A terminal application (Terminal on Mac and Linux or Git Bash on Windows).

### Credits
To be added later.
